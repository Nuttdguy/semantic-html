			<h1>Don't use flexbox for overall layout</h1>
			<p>Posted <time datetime="2014-02-05" > 05 February 2014</time> only after the previus post</p>
			<p>When I was building this blog I tried to use flexbox for the overall page layout because I wanted to look cool and modern in front of my peers. However, like all of my other attempts to look cool and modern, it didn't really work.</p>
			<p>Why? Well, take my hand and follow me into the next sectionâ€¦</p>
			<p><strong>Update:</strong> Don't let this post scare you off flexbox, it's one of the best layout systems we have on the web today. However, there's a growing problem on the web when it comes to content shifting around during loading. For large amounts of content, flexbox can cause this, whereas grid is less likely to, but more commonly content-shift is caused by JS modifying the DOM.</p>
